% Function positionEstimator has to return the x and y coordinates of the
% monkey's hand position for each trial using only data up to that moment
% in time.
% You are free to use the whole trials for training the classifier.

% To evaluate performance we require from you two functions:

% A training function named "positionEstimatorTraining" which takes as
% input the entire (not subsampled) training data set and which returns a
% structure containing the parameters for the positionEstimator function:
% function modelParameters = positionEstimatorTraining(training_data)
% A predictor named "positionEstimator" which takes as input the data
% starting at 1ms and UP TO the timepoint at which you are asked to
% decode the hand position and the model parameters given by your training
% function:

% function [x y] = postitionEstimator(test_data, modelParameters)
% This function will be called iteratively starting with the neuronal data 
% going from 1 to 320 ms, then up to 340ms, 360ms, etc. until 100ms before 
% the end of trial.


% Place the positionEstimator.m and positionEstimatorTraining.m into a
% folder that is named with your official team name.

% Make sure that the output contains only the x and y coordinates of the
% monkey's hand.
